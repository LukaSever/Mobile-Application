Mobile Application ( C# project )

This program is designed for a mobile store application. 
It includes the store name, its address, the total amount of bills, and the average amount of all bills. 
You can view a list of all bills, where the prices of each bill are displayed individually.
By clicking on a specific price, the description of the selected bill appears ( the same happens for bills that are cheaper or more expensive than the specified amount ). 
If you enter an amount, you can see the list of bills that are cheaper or more expensive than that amount. 
You can also view the cheapest and the most expensive bills.
